 <div class="contentrules"> <p>Participants in Diggers Beach Volleyball  play at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety and should only  play if they are capable. Check with your doctor before you begin.<br>
    Game fees must be paid prior to the start  of the game. Games may be cancelled up to 4 hours beforehand to get a refund.  Without 4 hours' notice, participants will forfeit the game and be charged 50%  of the game fee.The ball is put into  play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the  net to the opponent's court. A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in  addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A player  is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a  block. The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes  &quot;out&quot; or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits  a fault. The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the  receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its  players rotate one position clockwise. The best of three or best of five games  will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first  scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there  is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with  a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).</p>
