  <p>Volleyball  is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. The sport  originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of  popularity in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks  behind only soccer among participation sports. The object of the game is for each team to send  the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to  prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court.</p>
  <p>There are  millions of people all around the world who play volleyball at least once a  week. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does  not require extreme fitness. Since you don&rsquo;t have to move around the court too fast,  it&rsquo;s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit  without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive,  the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but  there&rsquo;s always a net between you and your opponents. Beach volleyball is suitable for people of  all ages, and men and women alike.Anyone considering starting a new sport or  exercise program should see a doctor first. </p>
