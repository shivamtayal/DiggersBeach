  <p>There are  millions of people all around the world who play volleyball at least once a  week. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does  not require extreme fitness. Since you don&rsquo;t have to move around the court too fast,  it&rsquo;s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit  without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive,  the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but  there&rsquo;s always a net between you and your opponents. Beach volleyball is suitable for peopleof  all ages, and men and women alike. Anyone considering starting a new sport or  exercise program should see a doctor first.  </p>
